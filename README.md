# blink1 playground

My scripts using blink(1) USB RGB LED by ThingM http://blink1.thingm.com/

*Inspired from examples in https://github.com/todbot/blink1/tree/master/python/pypi*

# Use

Simply run like this:

	python3 demo1.py

**Note**

* demo1.py needs you to compile from source the latest version of the python API, at least if you are using Ubuntu.
